# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout: single-context

This repo has one global context. One `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-self-hosted-livekit-sfu.md
├── AGENTS.md
└── server/ app/ shared/
```

No `CONTEXT-MAP.md`. No per-context `CONTEXT.md` files under `src/<context>/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the project's ubiquitous language / glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:
